## Nonlinear regression problems

- [https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/nls/nls_main.shtml](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/nls/nls_main.shtml) (up to 250 observations, < 10 paramters)

## Unconstrained and bound-constrained problems

- [OPM: subset of cutest in Matlab](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_HTML/2021/12/8720.html) need to translate these problems in Julia
- [Test Problems in Optimization, Xin-She Yang](https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.0549) scalable problems of Rosenbrock type. We will have to work a bit on the references for each problem.
